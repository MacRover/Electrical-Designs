MAKE SURE TO USE GREEN SOLDERMASK ONLY!

The pin spacing of the LM5122 is 0.2mm. The minimum pin spacing between copper pads 
to guarantee a soldermask bridge is 0.2mm for green soldermask and 0.254mm for other
colours. This is per JLCPCBs capabilities. Make sure to choose green soldermask when
ordering from JLCPCB or else they cannot guarantee a soldermask bridge between the
pins of the LM5122
