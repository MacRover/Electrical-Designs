NOTE: For the second battery, the MCP3021A5T-E/OT should be replaced with a chip that has a different hardcoded address, such as the MCP3021A6T-E/OT.
NOTE: The ADS1015IDGST must be configured with different resistors. Currently the 0 ohm resistors are placeholders, but spare resistors should also be used to configure this.
NOTE: With this particular header, the Molex 2695 connecter should be used.
